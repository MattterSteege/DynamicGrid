# DynamicGrid

## Introduction

DynamicGrid is a robust JavaScript library designed to manage and display dynamic, scrollable, and interactive data grids. It includes features such as virtual scrolling, custom plugins for handling various data types, and advanced UI configurations for optimal performance and flexibility. The library is particularly suited for use cases requiring large datasets to be displayed and manipulated efficiently within web applications.

## Features

- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficiently handles large datasets by rendering only visible rows.
- **Custom Plugins**: Support for string, number, and boolean type plugins with extensible plugin architecture.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Automatically adapts column widths and row heights.
- **Advanced Query Parsing**: Supports queries for sorting, grouping, filtering, and range-based data manipulations.
- **Responsive Design**: Configurable for different container sizes and devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes resizable columns, sortable headers, and detailed context menus.

## Installation

To include `DynamicGrid` in your project, use the following methods:

### Using npm
```bash
npm install dynamic-grid
```

### Using a script tag
```html
<script src="path/to/DynamicGrid.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example to set up and render a grid:

```javascript
const gridConfig = {
    engine: {
        useStrictCase: false,
        SymbolsToIgnore: ["_", "-"]
    },
    ui: {
        containerId: "#grid-container",
        virtualScrolling: true,
        rowHeight: 40,
        minColumnWidth: 10,
        autoFitCellWidth: "both",
    },
    headers: {
        name: "string",
        age: "number",
        active: "boolean"
    }
};

const dynamicGrid = new DynamicGrid(gridConfig);
dynamicGrid.importData(data, { type: "json" });
dynamicGrid.render("query string here");
```

## Configuration

### Grid Engine

- **`useStrictCase`**: (boolean) Enables strict case matching for column headers.
- **`SymbolsToIgnore`**: (array) Defines symbols to ignore during header matching.

### UI Settings

- **`containerId`**: (string) The ID of the container element.
- **`virtualScrolling`**: (boolean) Toggles virtual scrolling.
- **`rowHeight`**: (number) Height of a single row in pixels.
- **`minColumnWidth`**: (number) Minimum width for resizable columns.
- **`autoFitCellWidth`**: (string) Options: `"header"`, `"content"`, `"both"`, or `"none"`.

## Dependencies

The following plugins are required for `DynamicGrid` to operate effectively:

- **`TypePlugin`**: Abstract class for creating custom plugins.
- **`stringTypePlugin`**: Handles string operations such as sorting and filtering.
- **`numberTypePlugin`**: Processes numeric data with range and comparison queries.
- **`booleanTypePlugin`**: Manages boolean fields with options like "true" and "false."

## Examples

### Grouping Data
```javascript
dynamicGrid.group("columnName");
```

### Sorting Data
```javascript
dynamicGrid.sort("columnName", "asc");
```

### Querying Data
```javascript
const results = dynamicGrid.render("name == 'John' and age > 30");
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors
- **`GridError: Container not found`**: Ensure the `containerId` matches an existing DOM element.
- **`No plugin found for header`**: Verify headers and plugins are correctly defined.

### Debugging Tips
- Use the browser console to inspect logs and warnings generated by the library.
- Check the configuration for missing or incorrect keys.
